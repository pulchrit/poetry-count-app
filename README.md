# Poems, computed
Poems, computed is an asynchronous web app that searches a small poetry database for a poet or poets. You can enter a poet(s) name or you can select from a few sample searches. Then the program performs a word frequency analysis on the poems for each (or aggregate) poets and displays a word chart representing the word frequency for the top 100 words. You can also click buttons to view the data tables backing the word charts or to view the poems used in the analysis.
